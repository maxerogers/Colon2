    <h3 style="text-align:center"> What to expect after the Colonoscopy
</h3>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            Your child will be brought to the recovery room where he or she will continue to rest and allow the effects of the medication to wear off until he or she is fully awake and alert.
Your child may feel a little bloated and pass more gas than usual for several hours after the procedure.  This is normal.  A sore throat is also common if your child underwent general anesthesia, due to the use of a breathing tube. 
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
        Not more than about two (2) teaspoons of blood may be seen in your child's bowel movements for no longer than two (2) days following the procedure. If there seems to be more blood or the bleeding lasts longer than two (2) days call the doctor right away.
If biopsies have been taken it will take up to one week to receive the results from the lab.  Please call for your biopsy results one week following the procedure.
