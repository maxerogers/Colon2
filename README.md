Hey Gang,

To run this on your device use the command '$cordova run <device>'
For example: '$cordova run android' to run on an android

If you want to run through localhost so you can just observe it in the browser use '$cordova serve' the default port number is 8000. So go to your browser and enter 'http://localhost:8000' to go to the application

DON'T USE cordova serve, its static and bad
use instead '$python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000'
